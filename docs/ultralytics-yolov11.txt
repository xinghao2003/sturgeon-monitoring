Example

[PyTorch](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/pytorch) pretrained `*.pt` models as well as configuration `*.yaml` files can be passed to the `YOLO()` class to create a model instance in Python:

```
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a COCO-pretrained YOLO11n model
model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

# Train the model on the COCO8 example dataset for 100 epochs
results = model.train(data="coco8.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)

# Run inference with the YOLO11n model on the 'bus.jpg' image
results = model("path/to/bus.jpg")
```

CLI commands are available to directly run the models:

```
# Load a COCO-pretrained YOLO11n model and train it on the COCO8 example dataset for 100 epochs
yolo train model=yolo11n.pt data=coco8.yaml epochs=100 imgsz=640

# Load a COCO-pretrained YOLO11n model and run inference on the 'bus.jpg' image
yolo predict model=yolo11n.pt source=path/to/bus.jpg
